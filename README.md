# Cat and Dog Image Classification

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify images of cats and dogs. The model processes input images, learns the features of both classes (cat and dog), and outputs a binary classification indicating whether the image contains a cat or a dog.

## Project Overview

This project uses a CNN to classify images from a dataset of cats and dogs. The model is trained on labeled images, processes the images through convolutional and pooling layers, and uses fully connected layers to predict the class (cat or dog). The final output is a probability score, and the image is classified based on the highest probability.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

- `tensorflow` for building and training the model.
- `numpy` for data manipulation.
- `matplotlib` for plotting and visualization.
- `pillow` for image processing.

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pillow
```

## Dataset

The dataset consists of images of cats and dogs. The images are organized into directories:

- `/train`: Training images (separated into 'cats' and 'dogs' folders).
- `/validation`: Validation images (separated into 'cats' and 'dogs' folders).
- `/test`: Test images (unlabeled for evaluation).

You can download the dataset from a popular source such as Kaggle's "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset or use your own collection of images.

## Model Architecture

The model is a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the following layers:

1. **Conv2D Layer**: Applies filters to the input images to detect various features (e.g., edges, textures).
2. **MaxPooling2D Layer**: Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps to extract more important features.
3. **Flatten Layer**: Converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.
4. **Dense Layer**: A fully connected layer that classifies the images based on the extracted features.
5. **Output Layer**: Uses a sigmoid activation function to output a probability (binary classification).

The model is trained with the binary cross-entropy loss function and optimized using the Adam optimizer.

## Training

To train the model, the following steps are performed:

1. The training data is preprocessed (rescaling pixel values).
2. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.
3. The model is trained using the training dataset, and its performance is evaluated on a separate validation set.

Run the following code to start the training process:

```python
# Example code to train the model
history = model.fit(train_data_gen, steps_per_epoch=100, epochs=10, validation_data=val_data_gen, validation_steps=50)
```

## Evaluation

After training, the model's performance can be evaluated using the test dataset. The evaluation metrics include accuracy and loss, which can be used to determine how well the model is classifying images of cats and dogs.

```python
# Example code to evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_data_gen, steps=50)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_acc}")
```

## Usage

To use the trained model to classify new images, pass the image through the model's `predict()` function, which will output a probability for each class (cat or dog). You can then map the predicted probabilities to their corresponding class labels.

```python
# Example code to make predictions
predictions = model.predict(new_images)
```

The model outputs probabilities, which you can threshold to assign the class label (`cat` or `dog`).
